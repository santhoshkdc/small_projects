#Bagels

This program like many other programs listed in the directory 'small_projects' is taken its source and concepts from Al Swiegart's
"A Big Book Of Small Python Projects". It is an interesting text based game where the user has to guess a three digit number correctly within ten attempts and they will be presented with clues after each successfull attempt to get it right.
