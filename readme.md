# Python Projects

Working on projects is arguably the best way to sharpen coding skills so as to make the codes
relevant, readable, efficient and scalable. It is also one of the best ways to progress to achieve
an application. With that thought, I started working on these small projects that are most likely 
based on other existing projects. More often, these projects root from a book by Al Sweigart called
"The big book of small python projects" and they are held in a seperate subfolder. Even though I 
could have borrowed the goals of those that are already done and well documented, the codes I wrote
to achieve the same or similar results are my very own with the exceptions of few  instances where I
could have took the knowledge stright from some sources. I will most definitely  acknowledge them in 
my codes along with the necessary credentials. 

I hope to build bigger and better codes that can address more complex problems.
My end goal is to get familar with Python and SQL, and eventually get into data science.
