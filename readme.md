# Python Projects
Working on projects is arguably the best way to sharpen coding skills so as to make the codes
relevant, readable, efficient and scalable. It is also one of the best ways to progress to achieve
an application. With that thought, I started working on these small projects that are most likely 
based on other existing projects. More often, these projects root from a book by Al Sweigart called
"The big book of small python projects". Even though I have borrowed the goals of those that are already
done and well documented, the codes I wrote to achieve the same are my very own and except in a few 
instances where I might have took the knowledge stright from the sources which I will most definitely 
acknowledge in my codes along with the necessary credentials. 

I hope to build bigger and better codes that can address more complex problems.
My end goal is to get familar with Python and SQL, and eventually get into data science.
