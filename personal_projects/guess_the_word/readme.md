#Guess the Word!

The application is essentially a guess the word game' in which the user will be have to correctly find out a particular lettered word which is randomly generated from a copyright free text*. The user can make a specified number of attempts to guess the word correctly and after each unsuccessful attempt the application will provide the user with a clue. If the user fails to find the word within a speculative number of attempts, the user loses but they can always try again.

This code uses https://dictionaryapi.dev/ API to get some necessary data if the users were to need clues.

The text I used is actually the book 'The Time Machine' by H.G.Wells which I downloaded from The Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg is an online library of free eBooks.
